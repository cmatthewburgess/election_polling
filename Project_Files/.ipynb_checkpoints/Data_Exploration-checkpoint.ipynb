    "In Presidential, Senatorial, and Congressional elections across the United States, all campaigns and media outlets rely on polling. Exit polls help determine decisions on election day. Polls of Iowa in presidential primaries help determine the front-runner for a given race. But how often do these polls reflect the actual outcome of elections? More importantly, how wrong are they? My goal is to create a model that predicts the error of a poll from the actual result.\n",
    "\n",
    "I plan on using data from the data news site FiveThirtyEight on polls. It is roughly 10000 rows by 25 columns from polls since 1998. It not only includes data of polls of race by party, but also the year, partisan lean of both the pollster and the district, and real percentage of votes obtained by a candidate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Being able to reliably predict the percent error on a poll is arguably one of the single most important things for political campaigns. In knowing the error, polls can be determined as reliable or not, and percent error can be used to make key choices about the campaign moving forward.\n",

    "In exploring the data further, it reveals that there are NaN values only for cases where there is a third candidate being polled. If we explore this further, the election results also only reveal that there are only two values. In this case, it is okay to replace the relatively few NaNs with 0 because the percentage of that value in the poll approaches this anyway. This makes sense in a real-world application because the United State's two-party system only allows for third-party to obtain a de minimus percentage of the vote. This has notable exceptions in key presidential races, but those are not reflected in this data. As such, I will delete duplicate columns and fill NaNs with 0. Furthermore, the regression will throw an error if there are duplicate columns."

Positive values indicate that a Democrat did better in the poll than the actual election, and negative values mean a republican did better in the poll than the actual election. Significant outliers in bias and error will allow us to also complete more feature engineering as needed."

    "I am interested in creating a regression that predicts the error of a model. Because I suspect some features may have a greater impact on the result and I want to use the most up-to-date methods, I will start by using the following methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1) Basic Linear Regression**  \n",
    "Doing a basic linear regression on structured data is the best place to start. While I don't expect this to be the best starting point, linear regression will help reveal if we should be doing lasso or ridge regression due to collinearity with particular features, particularly the sample size of the poll. I believe that this could be overfit.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2) XGBoost Regression**  \n",
    "XGBoost is a Decision Tree algorithm that uses gradient boosting for decision tree algorithms to minimize loss among new models. In researching machine learning algorithms to use, XGBoost has been used as an industry standard for being computationally fast and producing an effective model. It also executes and adds new models of the decision tree forest under the hood, resulting in more accurate results.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3) Lasso Regression**  \n",
    "Lasso Regression is an effective algorithm for when we believe a particular feature may have an outsized weight on the regression. Lasso does this using an absolute value function within its regularization parameter, causing a more intense drop for outsized weights. In this way, it 'punishes' high values. If sample size has increased collinearity with the outcome, then Lasso should be able to handle this and predict the error.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4) Ridge Regression**  \n",
    "Ridge,like Lasso regression, also allows us to mitigate outsized variables and overfitting. It penalizes high values by using a squared magnitude rather than an absolute value. Using ridge in comparison with a Lasso will provide insight into which method is more effective at reducing model complexity."

    "## Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "In figuring out which algorithm best predicts the data, it is clear that XGBoost Regressor provides the best prediction of the error in election polling. Tt has a higher R-Squared value than lasso or ridge, and it also provides the lowest mean absolute error of 0.92. As a value of prediction of error, this means that the model is on average 0.92. Also, the 'error' value that we are predicting is a percentage, so our MAE of 0.92 means that we are usually within 1% for any value. XGBoost clearly is the best predictor.\n",
    "\n",
    "This also reveals that there does not seem to be an overfitting issue, as our Lasso and Ridge Regression models performed quite poorly.\n",
    "\n",
    "In applying this to a real-life political situation, reacting to new polling data and knowing how far we expect it to be off from the actual election result can have enormous political consequences. While this is just a start and there are various socio-political factors to also take into account, using this method of regression to predict error can be a great starting point, and provides many questions about future inquiry. We were ultimately able to predict the error of a poll from its general election outcome accurately 82% of the time, and our average error on that estimate was less than one percentage point."
